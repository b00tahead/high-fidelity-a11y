# .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Name of the workflow
name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events for the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build-and-test"
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up pnpm using the official pnpm GitHub Action
      - name: Set up pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 10 # Use pnpm version 9, or your preferred version

      # Step 3: Set up Node.js. The pnpm action automatically handles caching.
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20" # Specify the Node.js version you are using
          cache: "pnpm" # Use pnpm's cache

      # Step 4: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      # Step 5: Run linting across the entire monorepo using Turborepo
      - name: Run lint
        run: pnpm turbo run lint

      # Step 6: Run tests across the entire monorepo using Turborepo
      # This depends on the build step via the turbo.json config
      - name: Run tests
        run: pnpm turbo run test

      # Step 7: Run the build command across the entire monorepo using Turborepo
      - name: Run build
        run: pnpm turbo run build
